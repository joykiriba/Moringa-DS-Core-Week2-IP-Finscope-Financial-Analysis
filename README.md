It is a python notebook on exploratory descriptive analysis using a dataset obtained from Finscope surveys to figure out how we can predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account.
Financial Inclusion remains one of the main obstacles to economic and human development in Africa. For example, across Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda only 9.1 million adults (or 13.9% of the adult population) have access to or use a commercial bank account.
